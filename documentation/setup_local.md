pip install paddlepaddle-gpu==2.3.1

since I've installed `pyenv` which managers python versions
time to install whatever.

[pyenv documentation](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSystem%20Python%E2%80%9D%20is%20the%20Python,get%20a%20nice%20Python%20REPL.&text=To%20install%20a%20package%20into,to%20run%20sudo%20pip%20install%20.)

```sh
python local 3.5.10
```
this creates `.python-version` which manages python version for you.
